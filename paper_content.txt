ABSTRACT: 
Accurate forecast of home prices is crucial in making informed decisions in real estate, financial 
plans and investment practices. This work exploits the Volusia County Property Sales Dataset to 
create a strong machine learning model for predicting home prices. By undertaking extensive data 
preprocessing, feature engineering, and transformation of the outcome and having an XGBoost 
regression model as a result, we trained and measured its performance Metrics include R², MSE, 
and MAE.  The XGBoost model outperformed baseline models such as Random Forest (R² = 0.87) 
and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with R² = 0.97, MSE - 8.17, and MAE = 4.03, R² = 0.84. 
These results show the effectiveness and accuracy of XGBoost when identifying complex, 
nonlinear relations in the housing data. The proposed pipeline is scalable and can be adapted to 
fit into live property valuation systems, lending valuable insights to stakeholders in urban planning, 
real estate investments, and public policy formulations.

INTRODUCTION 
The industry of real estate is the bedrock of an economic upturn with an enormous influence on the 
wealth of people, national economies, and financial markets. Precise price prediction of homes is 
critical, and has implications to decisions of homeowners, investors, developers and policy makers 
in this field [1,2]. With the fluctuations in the supply and demand and interest rates, and the 
demographic trends and urban development, reliable pricing models are needed to make sense of 
this complexity. Conventionally at home valuation, a heuristic approach or simple linear regression 
model involving human appraisals with comparative market analysis has always been relied upon. 
Although these approaches have been commonplace, they are not capable of recording the 
multidimensional relationships and nonlinear trends that are inherent in housing markets [3,4]. From 
this increasing volume and diversity of data relating to housing, the traditional methods are doing 
their best to provide a constant level of accuracy, which most time results in biased or antiquated 
estimation, which is not reciprocal to real-time market dynamics. AI and ML, in turn, have appeared 
as the radically transformative technologies that can transform real estate analytics. As a subsection 
of AI, ML is particularly good at finding patterns in a large data set, learning, and offering predictive 
insights without requiring explicit programming of all situations [5]. In the case of a home price 
prediction, there are major benefits from using these ML regression models in contrast with the 
standard methods [6]. They are designed to handle complicated relationships between the features, 
like property size, location, amenities, construction year, and neighbourhood demographics, and 
tools for handling high dimensional data [7]. From historical data, these algorithms are able to make 
highly accurate estimates concerning price that is essential for strategic planning and competitive 
advantage when it comes to real estate transactions. Besides, ML models eliminate the human -
related error and bias, because data-based decisions are used instead of subjective judgment, and 
the pricing process becomes more objective and reproducible. Flexibility and the performance ability 
in various real estate markets are one of the strongest strengths of the AI -based regression model 
[8]. Methods like decision tree ensembles, SVM, and neural networks have proven considerable 
potential in nonlinearity and interaction between variables, which are normally not taken into account 
by previous model-based systems. These tools not only increase the accuracy of forecasts but also 
permit the interpretation of which variables have the greatest impact on the fluctuation of price [9] . 
For instance, feature importance analysis will tell which neighbourhood attributes, structural 
characteristics or economic indicators have maximum predictive power for the value of a property. 
This level of awareness can empower the stakeholders to understand the behaviour of market and 
make better decisions on pricing strategies, investment risk and distribution of resources [10].  
Since the real estate world continues to move with the trend of digitization and access to big data, 
there is no longer an innovation in integrating AI into predictive modelling but rather a requirement 
[11]. ML models' capacity to handle massive volumes of organized and unstructured data helps keep 
them in sync with market circumstances and forecast trends more correctly [12]. As distributed 
datasets of open properties and enhanced computational power become more available, there is an 
unparalleled opportunity to improve models of home price prediction and achieve new levels of 
accuracy and depth [13]. This paradigm shift is a major step forward in the methods of studying the 
housing markets from experience-based guesswork to intelligent data-based solutions [14]. 
Big Data is characterized by 5V’s: Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity and Value. Volume signifies 
the magnitude of data, often substantial in size. Velocity denotes the rate at which diverse data 
streams are in [2]. Variety pertains to the intricacy of both structured and unstructured data 
originating from diverse sources. Veracity pertains to the accuracy of obtained data and can tackle 
quality concerns such as noise or absent values. Value is the subsequent quality aspect crucial for 
locating pertinent data for analysis. Techniques like Classification, Prediction, Clustering, 
Dimensionality Reduction, Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and Outlier Analysis from data 
mining and Machine Learning is employed to discern patterns in fraudulent tr ansactions using 
gleaned data.

Motivation and Contribution of the Study 
The reason for which this study is initiated from the growing need for correct and smart real estate 
valuation tools in a volatile housing market. Traditional methods of valuation rely so much on manual 
assessment or systems based on heuristics, which may lead to inefficiency, inconsistency and lack 
of scalability. With the emergence of AI and ML, there is a great prospect of automating systems that 
give more accurate data-based predictions. This research is aimed at improving the accuracy of the 
prediction of the price of a home by advanced ML regression techniques, using real -world data of 
property transactions. The following contributions are the main findings of this research: 
• Utilization of the Voluspa County Property Sales Dataset, which offers comprehensive real estate 
transaction data suitable for predictive modelling. 
• Enhances data quality through data cleaning, outlier detection and removal, improving the 
precision and resilience of the model. 
• Performs feature engineering and selection to identify and construct relevant property attributes 
that significantly influence home prices. 
• Applies data transformation and target binning techniques to improve the structure and distribution 
of input features and the target variable. 
• Implements the XGBoost regression model, distinguished by its effectiveness and capacity to 
represent intricate, non-linear connections in tabular data. 
• Evaluates the model’s performance using R², MSE, and MAE to ensure accurate and reliable 
predictions. 
• Enables informed decision-making in real estate by providing a scalable and intelligent pipeline for 
home price prediction. 
Novelty of the Paper 
The novelty of this research lies in applying a robust AI -based pipeline using XGBoost to predict 
home prices with high accuracy. It incorporates comprehensive pre-processing, feature engineering, 
and target binning to enhance model performance. A two- phase modelling strategy refines 
predictions. Comparative analysis demonstrates XGBoost’s superior performance, surpassing 
existing models. This pipeline improves real estate analytics.

analytics for estimating residential property values. Some of the reviewed works are: 
Jiang and Shen (2019) study uses chain house network housing data is being utilized to forecast 
Shanghai's used house prices. They make use of a feedforward neural network model with many

prices in residential assets. A simple regression model is fitted, and SVM and RF are two examples 
of ML techniques that are employed.  The findings indicate that all regression models have an R -
squared greater than 0.9, indicating a strong match for asset pricing [16].

and the RMSE of anticipated outcomes is 0.12019 following the logarithm of all test data [18]. 
Wu (2017) examines how the economy and home values are related, with an emphasis on 
objectively forecasting home prices. The study makes use of an open -source dataset from King 
County, USA, which contains 21,613 house sales items and 20 explanatory characteristics. Several 
feature selection techniques and extraction algorithms are compared, such as RF Selector, Lasso, 
Ridge, and Recursive Feature Elimination. To extract features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
is used. With log transformation, feature r eduction, and parameter optimization, the SVR -built 
model's accuracy increases from 0.65 to 0.86. The study reveals that when it comes to estimating 
housing values in King County, USA, PCA-SVR and feature selection-SVR perform identically [19].

METHODOLOGY 
This section leverages AI -based ML regression approaches using the Volusia Property Sales 
Dataset to develop a predictive model for estimating property values. The procedure starts with data 
preparation, which includes cleaning and outlier detection/removal to improve data quality. Feature 
engineering and selection are then conducted to identify and construct relevant attributes, followed 
by transformation and target binning to maximize the inputs of the model. Subsets of the revised 
dataset are used for testing and training. An XGBoost model, known for its robustness and accuracy, 
is employed for classification or regression tasks depending on the objective. The model's 
performance is assessed utilizing measures like R2, MSE, and MAE to determine prediction  
accuracy and reliability. Finally, the results are interpreted to determine the model's accuracy in 
forecasting property value. This comprehensive approach ensures a structured pipeline from raw 
data to actionable insights, enhancing real estate analytics  for home price prediction as shown in

Data Collection 
The real estate datasets utilized in this research were gathered from the publicly available Voluspa 
County Property Appraiser website1. Maps, other related data, and an updated property sale 
database are among the datasets. By Florida Statutes and the Substantive Regulations of the Florida 
Department of Revenue, the database is updated every week. In particular, sales records and 
property information is collected, including the property's advertised and closing values. This 
research takes into account hous ing data from the previous five years, from January 1, 2015, to 
November 13, 2019, with a particular property prerequisite. First, the database's 62,723 entries with 
19 variables were taken out. The correlation matrix in Figure 2 illustrates the link between the feature 
display. 
Figure 2 displays a correlation matrix, which shows how several variables in a dataset relate to one 
another. The colour intensity of each cell represents the degree and direction (positive or negative) 
of the linear correlation between the two variables. Dark red represents significant positive 
correlations, dark blue represents strong negative correlations, and lighter colors show weaker 
connections.

Dataset Preprocessing 
Data pre-processing is vital for ensuring quality input in ML models. This study, it involved removing 
duplicates, dropping null values, detecting and removing outliers using Tukey’s IQR method, and 
selecting relevant features through correlation and feature importance techniques. These steps are 
described below: 
Data Cleaning 
The act of identifying and eliminating erroneous, corrupt, or unnecessary entries from a dataset in 
order to enhance its quality and dependability for analysis or modelling is known as data cleaning. It 
is a critical step in ensuring that the dataset is co rrect, consistent, and free of mistakes that might 
harm model performance. 
• Duplicate Entries Removed:  All duplicate rows were identified and eliminated to prevent 
redundancy and avoid potential data bias during model training and evaluation. 
• Null Values Dropped: Instead of using imputation techniques to estimate missing values, all rows 
containing null entries were removed. Given the initial dataset size of approximately 62,723 records, 
this approach was feasible and reduced the dataset to 50,809 clean and complete records, ensuring 
data integrity without compromising model reliability. 
Outlier Detection and Removal 
Outlier detection and removal began with Cook’s Distance to identify influential data points. The Z-
score method was tested but later discarded, as it flagged around 10% of the data as outliers, which 
was excessive. The final approach used was Tukey’s IQR method, which proved more effective. 
This method applied custom quantiles, setting Q1 at the 10th percentile and Q3 at the 90th 
percentile, to bin values and remove outliers based on the interquartile range. 
Feature Selection 
Feature selection involved removing irrelevant or weakly correlated features, such as ZIP code, to 
improve model performance. A Pearson Correlation Matrix was used to assess each feature's 
applicability to the target variable. Furthermore, feature signific ance approaches using XGBoost 
were applied to finalize a set of influential features for the model shown in Figure 5.

Feature Engineering 
Feature engineering identifies key features and removes fewer valuable ones to create a more 
efficient model. Most buyers purchase houses with two or three bedrooms for nuclear families, and 
the price tends to increase with the number of bedrooms. However,  this relationship weakens for

houses with 6 or 7 bedrooms, likely due to their rural locations. Housing transactions peak from May 
to August, likely due to summer vacations, while November to February sees fewer transactions. 
Feature Transformation and Target Binning 
 
it = σ(Vixt + Wiht−1 + bi)     (1) 
 
ft = σ(Vf xt + Wf h(t−1) + bf )      (2) 
 
c˜t = tanh(Vcxt + Wch(t−1) + bc)    (3) 
 
ct = ft   c(t−1) + it   ˜ct      (4) 
 
ot = σ(Voxt + Woh(t−1) + bo)     (5) 
 
ht = ot   tanh(ct)      (6) 
 
where  V*,  W*,  and  b*  are  learnable  parameters,  h*  is  the hidden state, where * is used in place 
of f, i, o, or c to represent the given gates and memory cell. Meanwhile, σ and tanh are the sigmoid 
and tanh activation functions and is the element-wise product 
The feature transformation and target binning process start by encoding selected features, like the 
selling date and year are programmed into ys1, ys2, yb1, and yb2. Step 1 creates a price range 
column with 100 bins, ranging from 0 to 100. After applying l evel encoding, the categorical feature 
is converted to a numerical value, stored as Pricebot. In Step 2, the price feature is dropped, and 
Pricebot is used as the target variable for training an XGBoost model, achieving an R-squared score 
of 0.91. Step 3 involves feeding predicted Pricebot values as inputs, removing outliers using IQR, 
and training the model on the actual price, which increases the R-squared score to 0.97. 
Data Splitting 
The dataset was split into two sets: training and testing. The training set was used to train the models, 
which were then tested on the test set. The training set contains 80% of the data, while the test set 
contains 20%. 
Classification of XGBoost Model 
XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting), established by Chen and Guestrin, is a high- performance 
gradient tree boosting method that has proven highly effective in prediction tasks, like as estimating 
housing prices. It works by constructing an ensemble of regression trees, with each tree correcting 
the mistakes of the preceding one, resulting in a powerful model that captures complex patterns in 
housing data [21]. At its core, XGBoost uses Cataloguing and Regression Trees (CARTs) as weak 
learners. In the context of predicting home prices, these trees learn from attributes that include 
location, year of construction, number of beds, square footage, and ease of access to facilities. Each 
tree attempts to minimize a regularized objective function that helps to avoid overfitting by balancing 
prediction accuracy and model complexity [22,23]. 
Given a dataset of homes {D,y}, where D contains the home features and y is the actual home price, 
the XGBoost model constructs an ensemble of p regression trees in Equation 7 . The prediction at 
boosting round t is:

Here, each 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡(𝑥𝑥) is a regression tree trained to model the residual errors from the previous 
predictions. This iterative learning from residuals allows XGBoost to incrementally improve its 
accuracy. The model is trained to minimize the following loss at each step in Equation (8,9): 
 
𝐿𝐿𝑡𝑡= ∑ 𝑙𝑙�𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖, 𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡−1(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖) + 𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡(𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖)� + Ω(𝑓𝑓𝑡𝑡)𝑛𝑛

P
erformance Metrics  
Performance metrics are a critical component of every machine -learning pipeline. In the case of 
regression tasks such as home price prediction, the model's concert was evaluated using R² 
coefficient of determination, MSE, and MAE [25]. 
R² 
The R² coefficient, determined as the modification ratio in the dependent variable that may be 
expected from the independent variable(s), is represented as follows Equation 10 [26].

RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
This study assesses the effectiveness of proposed regression models for a machine-learning-based 
prediction of the home prices. Experiments were performed using Python 3 with the use of such 
libraries as XGBoost and Scikit-Learn in a 64-bit Ubuntu system with an Intel Core i7 processor (3.80 
GHz, six-core) and 16 GB of RAM. The outstanding performance of XGBoost model in predicting 
home prices indicated in Table II is impressive. It had a value of R² of 97%, thus a high predictive 
power. MSE of 8.17 and MAE of 4.03 indicates little deviation from obtained values and confirms its

Figure 6. Performance of Xgboost Model for Home Price Prediction 
 
This bar chart in Figure 6 shows how an XGBoost model will perform for home price prediction with 
three metrics. The strong fit is suggested by R2 value of 97%. For MSE, the value of 8.17 is obtained, 
which is a reasonably small value. Regarding the MAE, the value of 4.03 is obtained, which is also 
a r elatively small value. Overall, these metrics indicate that the XGBoost model is useful for 
predicting prices of homes. 
 
 
Figure 7. Residuals for Xgboost Regressor Model 
 
Figure 7 is the residuals plot for an XGB Regressor in house price prediction, for which there is a 
difference between actual and predicted prices. Training data residuals (blue) present an R2 of 0.996 
and an R2 test data residuals (green) of 0.968, which both show a strong fit of the model. The random 
residuals around zero indicate unbiased prediction at various levels of house prices. As shown on 
the right the histograms, these prediction errors are distributed as shown for both data sets.

Figure 8. Prediction Error for Xgboost Model 
 
This scatter plot in Figure 8 depicts the comparisons between the predicted against the actual house 
prices in an XGB Regressor model. The blue dots are close to the dashed "identity” line thus 
representing valid predictions. The best fit line is almost al igned to the identity line. A strong 
correlation is confirmed by R-squared value of 0.968, that is the model predicts the prices of houses 
well. 
 
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS 
This section is A comparative study of several ML models used for the price predicting of houses. 
Table III presents different models’ performance comparisons in terms of R² values in a real estate 
dataset. The RF model performed well, with an R² of 87%, as it can cope with complex data. The 
ANN was next with an R² of 84 % which represented not as strong level of predictive capability as 
for the RF model, yet is very strong but slightly weaker than the RF model. However, XGBoost model 
had the best R² of 97% , meaning its performance in identifying intricate patterns and generating 
accurate home prices’ prediction was optimal.

The proposed technique of the XGBoost-based system outperforms other ML models for the home 
prices prediction task with a considerable margin. It has relatively better predictive accuracy than RF 
and ANN. Different from the conventional ones, XGBoost manages to exploit highly nonlinear 
relationships without lengthy tuning. Its robustness is overall ameliorated by sophisticated pre -
processing methods such as isolation of outliers using Tukey’s IQR and correlation- based feature 
selection, and smart target binning. When such steps are taken, the resulting model is the absence 
of noise and redundancy makes it steadier and more trustworthy. The model generalizes reasonably 
well to the unseen data with small amounts of over-fitting, and hence can be used in live real estate 
applications. Its scalabil ity and good performance make it a top remedy for dynamic market 
conditions and large-scale housing datasets. 
 
CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK 
The implementation of the ML technique, in particular, the XGBoost regression model, achieved an 
incredible amount of accuracy in terms of predicting home prices by using the real-world data on the

property. With an R² score of 0.97, having an MSE of 8.17 and MAE of 4.03, the model was 
exceptionally effective at modeling non-linear relationships of real estate features. Such performance 
exceeded the one of the other models, tested, like RF (R² = 87) and ANN (R² = 84). Some of the 
main factors that contributed to high performance are the well-performed Tukey’s IQR for the outlier’s 
removal, outstanding selection of features, and the innovative two-step target binning technique that 
increased the predic tion granularity. These findings bring to the fore the ability of AI -powered 
techniques to improve the valuation accuracy, help investors, policy makers and buyers make 
informed decisions predicated on data. Besides, the suggested approach is scalable and adaptable 
to a wider geographical deployment and different economic environments. Subsequent work will look 
at incorporating macroeconomic measures like interest rates and employment reports to enhance 
the set of features. Besides, the interpretation of models can also be improved with the help of 
Explainable AI (XAI) methods, guaranteeing reliability and openness. Expansion of the approach to 
multi-regional datasets and usage of ensemble learning techniques can better polish predictive skills 
and generalizability.
